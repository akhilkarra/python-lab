If characteristics are distributed completely randomly, the probability that two nodes \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) share characteristic \\(a\\) is the probability both nodes have characteristic \\(a\\) , which is the marginal probability of \\(a\\) squared. The total probability that nodes \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) share their characteristic is therefore the sum of the square of the marginal probabilities of each characteristic in the network.\n",
