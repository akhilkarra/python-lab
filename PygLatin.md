Ending Up
=========

Well done! However, now we have the first letter showing up both at the beginning and near the end.

s = "Charlie"

print s[0]  (will print "C")

print s[1:4] (will print "har")

* First we create a variable s and give it the string "Charlie"
* Next we access the first letter of "Charlie" using s[0]. Remember letter positions start at 0.
* Then we access a slice of "Charlie" using s[1:4]. This returns everything from the letter at position 1 up till position 4.
