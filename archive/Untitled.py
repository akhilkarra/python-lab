# Now, use the conditional statements if, elif and else to print out a specific variable to a specific input.

# Now, create a variable that contains an input of a specific type of aircraft:
airp = raw_input("Now pick an aircraft from the list: Airbus, Boeing and Embraer: ")

# Now create conditional statements that prints a specific variable with a specific input.
