Conditional Statement Syntax
============================

if is a conditional statement that executes some specified code after checking if its expression is True.

Here's an example of if statement syntax:

" if 8 < 9:
    print "Eight is less than nine!" "
    
In this example, 8 < 9 is the checked expression and print "Eight is less than nine!" is the specified code.
