    "Statistical learning is the process of using data to learn about the underlying distribution of a target variable.\n",
    "- supervised learning: the process of learning from data that has a known target variable\n",
    "- unsupervised learning: the process of learning from data that has no target variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning matches inputs and outputs, whereas unsupervised learning discovers structure for inputs only.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will learn about the basics of supervised learning in this case study. We will cover both regression (quantitative outcome) and classification problems (qualitative outcome).\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss functions are used to quantify the quality of a model. In regression, the most common loss function is the Mean Squared Error (MSE). In classification, the most common loss function is 0-1 Loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have a dataset and want to predict the relationship between a predictor variable $X$ and a target variable $Y$. The basics of regression involves finding an average point around a small subset of points in the dataset, and then predicting the value of $Y$ for a new point $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now say our data set has an output of just 0 and 1 (we have a classification problem now). We now want to estimate the outcome of the target variable $Y$ based on the predictor variable $X$ by finding the outcome of $Y$ with the highest probability for the given value of $X$."
